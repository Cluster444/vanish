# Vanish

Vanish brings a fresh take on a shell that is designed to allow many customizations as a first class concept. These customizations allow packages to build new features into the shell that can then potentially be used by other packages.

The core of vanish provides the underlying shell implementation that provides the OS resource management, basic input handling, command parsing and execution. From there a core set of packages are delivered with vanish to provide key features that are generally expected as part of a function shell like file system navigation and history.
